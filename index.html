	<p>Hello! My name is John Chang im orinially from Brooklyn New York, but ive been living in Atlanta GA for most of my life.<br> I Went to highschool in gwinnett county
		and i currently live in mid town. Ive lived in the city for the past ten years. I Love watching football my favorite football team is the Dallas Cowboys.<br> 
		I enjoy traveling the world,reading and playing call of duty. Watching shows are another one of my favorite things to do. Some of my favorite shows are Boardwalk Empire and breaking bad.<br>
	 My family is from Jamaica and i visit there every free chance i get. I have two kids ages 12 and 9. Im hoping after i graduate coding boot camp im able to teach my kids how to code. I think
    its really important for everyone to know computer language with everything being tech based.
